############################## DIRECTORY CONTENTS ##############################

The "OneTurn" and "TwoTurns" directories contain the files necessary to
visualize the trajectories using VMD:
    - Two coordinate files (npt.gro and npt_prot.gro). npt.gro contains the 
      whole system and npt_prot.gro, just the SK2+CaM coordinates.
    - A trajectory file (md.xtc), which only contains the SK2+CaM coordinates,
      and whose periodicity is not corrected.

The "md.tpr" and "index.ndx" files are needed to analyze the trajectories with 
standard Gromacs tools. The "plumed.dat" file is the Plumed input for the
metadynamics runs, and the "sk2_cam.ndx" and the "reference.pdb" files are 
called by "plumed.dat".

The "Scripts" directory contains scripts to perform analyses and to
generate plots. The comments in the scripts provide details on how to run them. 


########################## "ONE TURN" AND "TWO TURNS" ##########################

To correct the periodicity of the "one turn" and "two turns" trajectories 
(md.xtc), use the provided correctPeriodicityMetad.sh script.

To fix the HILLS file so that it does not contain repeated lines, use the
provided fix-HILLS-COLVAR.sh script.

To generate the last five free energy surfaces (which correspond to the last 
250 ns) as a function of the chosen collective variable 
[the (CaM)-(W431 Calpha)-(W431 aromatic ring) angle], use the provided 
genFESMetad.sh script.

Now, one can plot the time evolution of the collective variable and of the
free energy surfaces (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information) by using the 
provided plot_angle_fes.gpl Gnuplot script.

To generate the average and standard deviation of the last five free energy 
surfaces, use the provided compute_av_std_last_five_fes.sh script.

Now, one can plot the final free energy surface with error bars (Figure 7) 
by using the provided plot_fes_av_std_5.gpl Gnuplot script.

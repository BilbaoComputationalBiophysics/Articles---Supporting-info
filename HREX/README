############################## DIRECTORY CONTENTS ##############################

Each one of the "OneTurn", "TwoTurns", "OneTurnTRPOutward", "TwoTurnsTRPInward"
and "AdditionalIQmotifs" directories contains the files needed to visualize the 
trajectories using VMD:
    - Two coordinate files (npt.gro and npt_prot.gro). npt.gro contains the whole 
      system and npt_prot.gro, just the SK2+CaM coordinates.
    - A trajectory file (md.xtc), which only contains the SK2+CaM coordinates,
      and whose periodicity is not corrected.

In addition, the "OneTurn", "TwoTurns", "OneTurnTRPOutward" and
"TwoTurnsTRPInward" directories contain the md.log file, needed to generate
the HREX exchanges plots (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information).

The "md.tpr" and "index.ndx" files are needed to analyze the trajectories with 
standard Gromacs tools.

The "Scripts" directory contains scripts to perform analyses and to
generate plots. The comments in the scripts provide details on how to run them. 


########################## "ONE TURN" AND "TWO TURNS" ##########################

To correct the periodicity of the "one turn" and "two turns" trajectories 
(md.xtc),  (and their W431-rotated versions), and to compute the time evolution 
of the SK2 secondary structure content, its RMSF and SASA per residue, and the 
W431-CaM and L426/V427-CaM contacts, use the provided 
pbc-SS-RMSF-SASA-contacts.sh script.

This script generates the ss.xpm, rmsf_channel.xvg, sasaSK2.xvg, and 
contactMap.xpm files. By using the provided plot_sscontent_vs_time.sh script,
 one can generate the plots in Figures 2 and 5 (time evolution of secondary 
structure content).

To compute SASA differences between the "one turn" and "two turns"
systems, use the provided compute_sasa_diffs.sh script, which generates
sasaSK2diff.xvg. 

To change the format of contactMap.xpm so that it can then 
be plotted with Gnuplot, use the provided reformatXPMContactsFile.sh, which 
generates contactMap.dat. To filter the W341 and L427/V26 contacts from
contactMap.dat, use the provided extract-W431-L427-contacts.sh script.

In the case of the W431-rotated versions of the trajectories, we analyzed the
W431-CaM and V426/L427-CaM contacts over the frames where SK2 was in a fully 
alpha-helical conformation. To extract these frames, use the provided
list-helical-frames.sh and extract-helical-frames-contacts.sh scripts.  

Now one can generate Figures 4 and 6 (RMSF, SASA, and contacts analysis).
by using the provided plot_rmsf_sasa_contacts.gpl and 
plot_rmsf_sasa_contacts_2.gpl Gnuplot scripts, respectively. 

To compute the replica exchanges plotted in Figure S5, use the provided 
demux_mod.pl script on the md.log files, followed by the provided
correct_replica_index_temp.sh script 
To plot Figure S5, use the provided plot_repl_exchanges.gpl Gnuplot script.


############################# ADDITIONAL IQ MOTIFS #############################

To correct the periodicity of the addtional IQ motifs trajectories and
to compute the time evolution of their secondary structure, use the provided
pbc-SS_iqmotifs.sh script

To plot the result (Figures S3 and S4) use the provided 
plot_sscontent_vs_time_additionalIQmotifs.sh script.
